LGBTQPortrayal:AuthenticRepresentation rdfs:comment "Represents portrayals characterized by depth, nuance, and cultural accuracy in the depiction of LGBTQ+ identities. Instances of this class exhibit alignment with lived experiences and resist reductive or stereotypical frameworks." .


LGBTQPortrayal:ComicSidekick rdfs:comment "Refers to portrayals where LGBTQ+ characters are positioned as secondary figures, often providing comic relief or functioning as accessories to the main (typically heterosexual) protagonist. This class captures a recurrent trope that can both enable visibility and reinforce marginalization." .


LGBTQPortrayal:Detailed rdfs:comment "Represents character portrayals that are richly developed in terms of personality, motivations, emotional complexity, and narrative significance. These characters often undergo development arcs, interact with multiple plotlines, and are situated within believable social and psychological contexts." .


LGBTQPortrayal:NegativeRoleModel rdfs:comment "Describes portrayals that reinforce harmful stereotypes, lack complexity, or depict queerness as deviant, tragic, or marginal. These representations may contribute to internalized stigma or societal misunderstanding, undermining the potential for positive cultural impact." .


LGBTQPortrayal:PositiveRoleModel rdfs:comment "Represents LGBTQ+ characters whose portrayal is empowering, multifaceted, and affirming of queer identity. These characters serve as relatable figures for LGBTQ+ audiences, promoting self-acceptance and challenging social biases through their visibility and narrative agency." .


LGBTQPortrayal:QueerProtagonistLeadRole rdfs:comment "Defines characters who occupy central narrative roles and whose LGBTQ+ identity is integral to the storyline. These roles often influence the plot’s direction, embody agency, and challenge heteronormative tropes." .


LGBTQPortrayal:SexOrientation rdfs:comment "Describes the sexual orientation of the creator or performer, where disclosed or relevant. This class allows analysis of whether LGBTQ+ roles are portrayed or written by members of the community." .


LGBTQPortrayal:Superficial rdfs:comment "Refers to portrayals that lack narrative complexity or emotional depth. These characters may be flat, underdeveloped, or stereotypical, with limited screen time or relevance to the plot. Their identity is often reduced to a single trait or function (e.g., comic relief, sidekick)." .


LGBTQPortrayal:TokenCharacter rdfs:comment "Captures a representation pattern where LGBTQ+ characters are included primarily for the sake of surface-level diversity, without substantial narrative depth or character development. These portrayals are typically isolated and do not affect the plot meaningfully." .
